{"title":"第24章","title_en":"Chapter 24","data_en":[{"english":"It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply."},{"english":"“Ah,” I said to the little prince, “these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!”"},{"english":"“My friend the fox—” the little prince said to me."},{"english":"“My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!”"},{"english":"“Why not?”"},{"english":"“Because I am about to die of thirst...”"},{"english":"He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:"},{"english":"“It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend...”"},{"english":"“He has no way of guessing the danger,” I said to myself. “He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs...”"},{"english":"But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:"},{"english":"“I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well...”"},{"english":"I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking."},{"english":"When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince’s last words came reeling back into my memory."},{"english":"“Then you are thirsty, too?” I demanded."},{"english":"But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:"},{"english":"“Water may also be good for the heart...”"},{"english":"I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him."},{"english":"He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:"},{"english":"“The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.”"},{"english":"I replied, “Yes, that is so.” And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight."},{"english":"“The desert is beautiful,” the little prince added."},{"english":"And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams..."},{"english":"“What makes the desert beautiful,” said the little prince, “is that somewhere it hides a well...”"},{"english":"I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart..."},{"english":"“Yes,” I said to the little prince. “The house, the stars, the desert—what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!”"},{"english":"“I am glad,” he said, “that you agree with my fox.”"},{"english":"As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: “What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...”"},{"english":"As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: “What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower—the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep...”"},{"english":"And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind..."},{"english":"And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak."}],"data_zh":[{"chinese":"这是我在沙漠上出了事故的第八天。我听着有关这个商人的故事，喝完了我所备用的最后一滴水。"},{"chinese":"“啊！”我对小王子说，“你回忆的这些故事真美。可是，我还没有修好我的飞机。我没有喝的了，假如我能悠哉游哉地走到水泉边去，我一定也会很高兴的！”"},{"chinese":"小王子对我说：“我的朋友狐狸......”"},{"chinese":"“我的小家伙，现在还说什么狐狸！”"},{"chinese":"“为什么？”"},{"chinese":"“因为这就要渴死人了。”"},{"chinese":"他不理解我的思路，他回答我道：“即使快要死了，有过一个朋友也好么！我就为我有过一个狐狸朋友而感到很高兴......”"},{"chinese":"“他不顾危险。”我自己思量着，“他从来不知道饥渴。只要有点阳光，他就满足了......”"},{"chinese":"他看着我，答复着我的思想：“我也渴了......我们去找一口井吧......”"},{"chinese":"我显出厌烦的样子：在茫茫的大沙漠上盲目地去找水井，真荒唐。然而我们还是开始去寻找了。"},{"chinese":"当我们默默地走了好几个小时以后，天黑了下来，星星开始发出光亮。由于渴我有点发烧，我看着这些星星，象是在做梦一样。小王子的话在我的脑海中跳来跳去。"},{"chinese":"“你也渴吗？”我问他。"},{"chinese":"他却不回答我的问题，只是对我说：“水对心也是有益处的......”"},{"chinese":"我不懂他的话是什么意思，可我也不做声......我知道不应该去问他。"},{"chinese":"他累了，他坐下来。我在他身旁坐下。沉默了一会，他又说道：“星星是很美的，因为有一朵人们看不到的花......”"},{"chinese":"我回答道：“当然。”而我默默地看着月光下沙漠的褶皱。"},{"chinese":"“沙漠是美的。”他又说道。"},{"chinese":"确实如此。我一直很喜欢沙漠。坐在一个沙丘上，什么也看不见、听不见。但是，却有一种说不出的东西在默默地放着光芒......"},{"chinese":"“使沙漠更加美丽的，就是在某个角落里，藏着一口井......”"},{"chinese":"我很惊讶，突然明白了为什么沙漠放着光芒。当我还是一个小孩子的时候，我住在一座古老的房子里，而且传说，这个房子里埋藏着一个宝贝。当然，从来没有任何人能发现这个宝贝，可能，甚至也没有人去寻找过。但是，这个宝贝使整个房子着了魔似的。我家的房子在它的心灵深处隐藏着一个秘密......"},{"chinese":"我对小王子说道：“是的，无论是房子，星星，或是沙漠，使它们美丽的东西是看不见的！”"},{"chinese":"“我真高兴，你和我的狐狸的看法一样。”小王子说。"},{"chinese":"小王子睡觉了，我就把他抱在怀里，又重新上路了。我很激动。就好象抱着一个脆弱的宝贝。就好象在地球上没有比这更脆弱的了。我借着月光看着这惨白的面额，这双紧闭的眼睛，这随风飘动的绺绺头发，这时我对自己说道：“我所看到的仅仅是外表。最重要的是看不见的......”"},{"chinese":"由于看到他稍稍张开的嘴唇露出一丝微笑，我又自言自语地说：“在这个熟睡了的小王子身上，使我非常感动的，是他对他那朵花的忠诚，是在他心中闪烁的那朵玫瑰花的形象。这朵玫瑰花，即使在小王子睡着了的时候，也象一盏灯的火焰一样在他身上闪耀着光辉......”这时，我就感觉到他更加脆弱。应该保护灯焰：一阵风就可能把它吹灭......"},{"chinese":"于是，就这样走着，我在黎明时发现了水井。"}]}
