The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him."},{"english":"It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me."},{"english":"The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:"},{"english":"“What is that object?”"},{"english":"“That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane.”"},{"english":"And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly."},{"english":"He cried out, then:"},{"english":"“What! You dropped down from the sky?”"},{"english":"“Yes,” I answered, modestly."},{"english":"“Oh! That is funny!”"},{"english":"And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously."},{"english":"Then he added:"},{"english":"“So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?”"},{"english":"At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly :"},{"english":"“Do you come from another planet?”"},{"english":"But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:"},{"english":"“It is true that on that you can’t have come from very far away...”"},{"english":"And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the “other planets”. I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject."},{"english":"“My little man, where do you come from? What is this ‘where I live’, of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?”"},{"english":"After a reflective silence he answered:"},{"english":"“The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house.”"},{"english":"“That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to.”"},{"english":"But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:"},{"english":"“Tie him! What a queer idea!”"},{"english":"“But if you don’t tie him,” I said, “he will wander off somewhere, and get lost.”"},{"english":"My friend broke into another peal of laughter:"},{"english":"“But where do you think he would go?”"},{"english":"“Anywhere. Straight ahead of him.”"},{"english":"Then the little prince said, earnestly :"},{"english":"“That doesn’t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!”"},{"english":"And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:"},{"english":"“Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far...”"}],"data_zh":[{"chinese":"我费了好长时间才弄清楚他是从哪里来的。小王子向我提出了很多问题，可是，对我提出的问题，他好象压根没有听见似的。他无意中吐露的一些话逐渐使我搞清了他的来历。例如，当他第一次瞅见我的飞机时（我就不画出我的飞机了，因为这种图画对我来说太复杂），他问我道：“这是个啥玩艺？”"},{"chinese":"“这不是‘玩艺儿’。它能飞。这是飞机。是我的飞机。”"},{"chinese":"我当时很骄傲地告诉他我能飞。于是他惊奇地说道：“怎么？你是从天上掉下来的？”"},{"chinese":"“是的”。我谦逊地答道。"},{"chinese":"“啊？这真滑稽。”"},{"chinese":"此时小王子发出一阵清脆的笑声。这使我很不高兴。我要求别人严肃地对待我的不幸。然后，他又说道：“那么，你也是从天上来的了！你是哪个星球上的？”"},{"chinese":"即刻，对于他是从哪里来的这个秘密我隐约发现到了一点线索；于是，我就突然问道：“你是从另一个星球上来的吗？”"},{"chinese":"可是他不回答我的问题。他一面看着我的飞机，一面微微地点点头，接着说道：“可不是么，乘坐这玩艺儿，你不可能是从很远的地方来的......”"},{"chinese":"说到这里，他就长时间地陷入沉思之中。然后，从口袋里掏出了我画的小羊，看着他的宝贝入了神。"},{"chinese":"你们可以想见这种关于“别的星球”的若明若暗的话语使我心里多么好奇。因此我竭力地想知道其中更多的奥秘。"},{"chinese":"“你是从哪里来的，我的小家伙？你的家在什么地方？你要把我的小羊带到哪里去？”"},{"chinese":"他沉思了一会，然后回答我说：“好在有你给我的那只箱子，夜晚可以给小羊当房子用。”"},{"chinese":"“那当然。如果你听话的话，我再给你画一根绳子，白天可以栓住它。再加上一根扦杆。”"},{"chinese":"我的建议看来有点使小王子反感。"},{"chinese":"“栓住它，多么奇怪的主意。”"},{"chinese":"“如果你不栓住它，它就到处跑，那么它会跑丢的。”"},{"chinese":"我的这位朋友又笑出了声：“你想要它跑到哪里去呀？”"},{"chinese":"“不管什么地方。它一直往前跑......”"},{"chinese":"这时，小王子郑重其事地说：“这没有什么关系，我那里很小很小。”"},{"chinese":"接着，他略带伤感地又补充了一句：“一直朝前走，也不会走出多远......”"}]}
